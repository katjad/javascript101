# Roadmap(s)
The JS101 group is just over 2 years old and has changed and evolved over that time. On this page, we share what we have learned about how to learn. It's not so much a strict roadmap, but rather advice on how to put together your own.

*Note: We don't teach JavaScript, this is not a linear course. You are responsible for your own learning, but we believe that reserving a time and place for it, and coding together with other developers, can enhance your learning a lot.*       
<br />                                            
## What and how do you learn

**1. Set goals**       
(..and feel free to change them every now and then)     
Think about why you are learning Javascript and what you are aiming to achieve and break it down into a list of goals. (We once tried to get everybody to publish a list, but [only two members did](https://github.com/CodeHubOrg/discussions/issues/44).. It is anyway more important to do it for yourself.) At the beginning of a meetup, talk about what you have achieved, what things you found difficult etc.      

**2. Look out for members that have similar goals**
(e.g. others who work through Free Code Camp), or who have expertise in something you want to learn about / want help with      

**3. Think about doing a little presentation about something you have learned**     
Nothing consolidates knowledge more than telling/teaching others about it!         
<br />           

Some questions that might help you to decide what to do each session, alongside what we currently aim for as a group

| Questions      | CodeHub         | Individual  |
| ------------- |-------------| -----|
|1. What is your overall goal?  | Providing a collaborative learning environment for learning Javascript best practises to industry standard. |Is my goal to work as a (front-end) developer?  <br />Is there a particular area within JS that I need to or want to learn?  <br />Are there some intersecting skills I'd like to learn? Git, Command line, presenting about code?  <br />If more advanced, would I like to get experience in mentoring people? |
|2. What to work on in the upcoming coding session?    | Currently: <br />- Working on a site for the group <br />- Working on a React-Redux App |  Am I at this point interested in collaborating on a project? Or would I rather concentrate on learning JS syntax and concepts for now?  |
|3. What is a good resource or topic to work through at the moment? | We started short presentations about functions (from how to declare them to higher order functions) Would be a good thing to pick up again I think!  | Possible resources for beginners: <br />- Free Code Camp <br />- Udacity <br />- Books: Eloquent JavaScript, YDKJS<br />See [Getting started](/getting-started) |


## A generic roadmap  
       
If you are just interested in learning JavaScript as a language, this is a breakdown of steps. You can start building and contributing at any step, of course, though I find it helps a lot to have gained some fluency.        
         
1. Learn syntax, data types
2. Get familiar with certain concepts of the language*
3. Gain fluency by doing coding challenges
4. Build something
5. Collaborate on a project (JS101 site + app!)
6. Collaborate on open-source / find a job
      
*Also check out the second column on this page [https://github.com/orgs/CodeHubOrg/projects/1](https://github.com/orgs/CodeHubOrg/projects/1).        
[You don't know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) is very good for learning about JS concepts

Other skills useful to know  about in front-end development (and essential for most jobs): HTML, CSS, basic commandline, Git - we sometimes go on little side trips to cover these, especially [Git](/getting-started/git)
               
I have found there is a certain back and forth between studying language concepts and then practicing, either by doing coding challenges, or building something. You start working through a book but then start intensely working on a project, and forget the book.. or you discover another one and start working through that. But perhaps other people are more consistent than me!

Finally, here are some [fantastic roadmaps](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/blob/master/README.md) with different technologies to learn if you want to go into web development
