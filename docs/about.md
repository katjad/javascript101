# About

Javascript 101 is a [CodeHub Bristol](https://www.meetup.com/CodeHub-Bristol/) meetup group. We get together every other at 10am - 1pm at the [Beatroot cafe](http://www.beatrootcafe.com/) in Bristol, UK.

Our main objective is to learn the JavaScript language to industry standards by supporting and encouraging each other. We do this by preparing [short presentations](https://javascript101.gitbooks.io/guide/content/presentations.html), running project demos, pair programming, suggesting resources and collaborating with each other.

## Mission Statement

A collaborative learning environment for learning Javascript best practises to industry standard.

## Format

We spend most of our time coding. Participants suggest topics that we can explore together - e.g. functions, callbacks, the DOM, ES6, etc. We also suggest coding challenges for beginners, like the ones found in the [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)\).

Some people prefer to work through [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) or similar online learning courses. 

We encourage everyone to give a presentation when they feel ready; this is a good way to learn and consolidate your knowledge. 

We occasionally include a "whiteboard session" where we have talk about programming concepts, e.g. the different ways to declare a function. You don't have to sit through a session if you aren't interested;  you are welcome to do your own thing.

## Is this group for me

Hopefully, we have provided enough information in order for you to decide whether this group is for you.

Our emphasis is about learning JavaScript as a programming language.
If you are an advanced programmer, we would also love to hear from you. If you can spare a Tuesday morning, come and say hello and maybe answer one or two questions about JavaScript :)

All skill levels are welcome!

## Related Meet Ups

[CodeHub](https://www.meetup.com/CodeHub-Bristol/) also organises a JavaScript hack night at the Momentum Offices every other Tuesday 6pm - 9pm.

[Bristol JS](https://www.meetup.com/BristolJS/) is another great meet up group that holds talks and a social in the pub afterwards.

[Simple Web](https://www.meetup.com/simpleweb/) holds hack nights from time to time.
