## Group Chat
We use [Gitter](https://gitter.im) to discuss JavaScript, our[Projects](projects.html),share useful [Resources](resources.html) and keep the conversation going. Create a [github](https://github.com/) account and [join in](https://gitter.im/CodeHubOrg/discussions)! Then request to join CodeHubOrg on Github to start collaborating.


## Code Editors
There are many text editors to choose from such as [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Vim](www.vim.org/), etc. Or choose from other powerful IDE's such as [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/).

 Browser based playgrounds such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) and [Plunker](https://plnkr.co/) are great for trying things out.  
 
  If you want to do some remote pair programming, we have found [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) to be a very good tool. It allows you to easily set-up and deploy an app.

## Web Developer Tools
You can't do web authoring without good developer tools. We recommend using:

* [Chrome Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools)
* [Firefox Developer Tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/son/docs/Tools)

## Source Control
Source control allows you to manage versions of your code and contribute to projects.  We use [git](https://git-scm.com/) and host our projects on [github](https://github.com/CodeHubOrg).  We recommend using [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to get started easily and progressing to the [command line](/getting-started/git) later.  

Why not try our [playground challenge](https://github.com/CodeHubOrg/git-playground)?

## Command Line
[Learning the command line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) allows you utilize powerful tools and manage projects.


## Package Management
We recommend installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install packages and run workshops.

## Frameworks
You might be interested in learning a JavaScript framework.  We recommend getting to grips with the JavaScriptlanguage basics first. However, we have been focusing in learning [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and you can contribute to our [React app](https://github.com/CodeHubOrg/organisations-database)

## Projects
A great way to learn JavaScript is to get started with making your own project. If you have been thinking about solving a particular problem, this might be an opportunity to start coding your project. Whether it's your first component, website or mobile app, you will get plenty of encouragement to keep it going.

You might like to get involved and contribute to one of our own projects. Find out more on our [Projects page](projects.html).

## Online Courses
You might find working through an online course helpful.  [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) is a group favourite and is the most [starred project](https://github.com/search?q=stars:%3E1&s=stars&type=Repositories) on github at time of writing.

Other options include:
* [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
* [Tree House](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/topic:javascript)
* [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-basics--ud804)
* [Introduction to Programming Course](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-9) with MIT on Edx.


## Books
If you are new to JavaScript [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) is an excellent introduction to JavaScript with online exercises.

## Further Resources
It's particularly important with JavaScript to make sure the resources you're using are up to date - a resource that's just a couple of years old can be way out of date; Javascript frameworks and methods are evolving rapidly.

Find out about the best and most up to date resources on our [Resources page](resources.html).

## Progressing
Check out our [Visual Roadmap](/getting-started/roadmap-visual) page to see a suggestion of different programming activities for different levels of JavaScript. Or read about [integrating your goals with those of the group](/getting-started/roadmap).
